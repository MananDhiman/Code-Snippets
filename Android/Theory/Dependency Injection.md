## **What is Dependency Injection?**

**Answer:** Any business application is made up of two or more classes and these classes collaborate with each other to perform some operation. Traditionally, we create the instance of dependent class object and do the required operations. When applying Dependency Injection, the objects are given their dependencies at creation time by some external entity that coordinates each object in the system. It means dependencies are injected into objects.

In other words, Dependency injection is a style of object creation in which an objects are created by an external entity, or technique whereby one object supplies the dependencies of another object.
